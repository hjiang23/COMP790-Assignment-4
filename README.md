# COMP790-Assignment-4

Added fixed time-step rendering, fixed the bug we talked about in class for going out of bounds.
Also added arrow key controls to speed up/slow down the character, and a score tally.

Description: A person and house spawn in a random location on canvas. 
When the character's chest touches the door the animation will stop and the score will increase by 1.
The user can restart the animation with new random positions and control the character's movement speed/direction.
